<h1><b><i>HISTORICAL BACKGROUND</i></b></h1><p>
    <h3>On August 15, 1947, India gained independence.
    There was an urgent need for elections shortly after independence so that the people could elect a true representative government for the country.
    Article 324, which authorizes the establishment of an election commission as an independent constitutional authority, went into effect on November 26th, 1949.
    Elections in India were a result ofthe Election Commission of India, marking a watershed moment in the country's history.
    The election commission was established formally on January 25, 1950, just one day before India became a Sovereign Democratic Republic.
    The appointment of the chief election commissioner was the next step.
    Shri Sukumar Sen was appointed as the first Chief Election Commissioner of independent India on March 21, 1950.
    The President of India issued the first delimitation order for the first general elections to the Lok Sabha and Vidhan Sabha after the election commission was established.
    This was done with the help of the newly formed election commission.
    On May 12, 1950, the Indian parliament passed the Representation of the People Act to provide a legal framework for the conduct of elections.
    The following year, on July 17, 1951, the Indian parliament passed the second Representation of the People Act.
    Both of these Acts outlined the procedures for holding elections to both Houses of Parliament and the Vidhan Sabha in each state.</h3></p>
